# Intro to Developing R packages source code

If you are a participant, no need to interact with this repository!! 

Instead, Check out [Developing R packages](https://connect.fisheries.noaa.gov/developing-r-packages), rendered from [developing_rpkgs.qmd](https://github.com/NSAWTraining/Rpkgs/blob/main/developing_rpkgs.qmd).

If you would like to use Codespaces to work through the training, you can use the [RpkgsCodespace template](https://github.com/NSAWTraining/RpkgsCodespace) by navigating to the RpkgsCodespace repository and following the readme instructions there.
